# SPARC-image-handling
Applications for managing National Institute of Health SPARC program data and interfacing with Blackfynn data warehouse

Initially, imageFileManager.py application was written to format large local repository of image research data by overdue data compliance milestone. See SPARC-BIDS data formatting standard

Source image data was generated by separate users, with highly inconsistent formats for each user. Original source and paths could not be modified in any way. Sparc compliance necessitated parsing source image metadata stored as file paths and generating conforming SPARC-BIDS filepaths. 

Additional dataWarehouseUpload.py application was written to interface with 3rd party data warehouse (Blackfynn) API and upload local repository using input csv tables.

File manager and Upload applications were later refactored to OOP conforming classes in SparcDataOOP.py
